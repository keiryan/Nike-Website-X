Chnage img's from CSS to html and wrap in link (or <a> tags) for larger clickbox. ✅

Find height on image by inspecting and set div to this height. (to constrain product divs to dimensions of CSS background images)

Found alternative solution:

Set div to flexbox column and use relative positioning to center div contents. (div within div) ✅


For Top Animations:

Notice how uls load slightly later than container.

Does this prevent a choppy overlaying animation?


Question for Lucas: Can I use multiple H2 tags on a page? ✅

Answer: Don't worry about it. ✅

To look at later:

Margin vs TranslateX/Y for bubble links.
Padding for sides of middle container .


Can <a> tags wrap around div with no links in them? / How to resize a link to a whole div size?

Align-content vs class based body spacing.

To fix nav-div animations:

Restructure code so that all links share a class of something like "top-nav-link-divs" (or something similar) and all are able to draw out the the ul-links-large-container, and then set a seperate animation for drawing out individual ULs upon hovering.

(Maybe set a div within ul-links-large-container so I dont have to rewrite the code over and over again. Does that make sense? Maybe not.)

Fix "top-nav-link-ul" list-style. ✅


Fix the vertical spacing of the "join-us" banner contents. --> Change to CSS-Background Image.

Fix top-nav-link-ul-div spacing. (Men page)

Fix Footer heading left spacing. (padding) ✅

Style bottom right footer links. (set to white, opacity 0.5, and then 1 for hover.) ✅

Fix h3 ul-large-container elements: wrap h3 in link - instead of the other way around.


Maybe set hard widths to large divs inside container so content can be justified in new div and ul-large-container can be set to justify-center
